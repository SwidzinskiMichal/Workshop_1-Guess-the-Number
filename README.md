# Workshop_1-Guess-the-Number
Small guessing game.

## Description
A random number in range 1 to 100 (including both extremes) is chosen at the start of the game.
Player proceeds to guess the number with a clue (Too big!/ Too small!) being given between each guess depending whether
the guess is bigger or small than the random number chosen at the start of the game. 
Once the number is guessed the program will print "You Win!" message.
Numbers outside of range(both possitive and negative), string, floats or numbers of type other than ones that can not 
be turned into will cause a prompt to print out stating that the choice is invalid and looping again to choose again.
